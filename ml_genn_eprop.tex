\section{Introduction}
In recent years, several new techniques for directly training spiking neural networks~(SNNs) using gradient-based approaches have been developed.
The discontinuity of spiking neuron's membrane potentials when they emit a spike is problematic when deriving gradients.
One approach to work around this problem is to replace the derivative of the membrane potential with a `surrogate gradient'~\citep{Bohte2011,Bellec2018,Zenke2021a}, allowing SNNs to be trained with the same algorithms used to train rate-based Recurrent Neural Network~(RNNs) such as Back Propagation Through Time~(BPTT).
While BPTT is computationally efficient, because it requires gradients to be stored during the forward pass in order for them to be applied during a backward pass, it has a memory requirement which grows with time preventing it from being applied to long input sequences or used online.
RTRL~\citep{Williams1989} is an alternative `forward mode' algorithm for training RNNs but, in its general form, it is too computationally expensive to be practical.
However, if the gradients flowing through the `explicit' recurrent connections are ignored and only those flowing through the `implicit' recurrence represented by the dynamics of individual neurons are considered, much more computationally tractable learning rules can be derived~\citep{Zenke2021}.
Learning rules of this sort include SuperSpike~\citep{Zenke2018}, eProp~\citep{Bellec2020} and Decolle~\citep{Kaiser2020}.
However, in order to apply these new spike-based machine learning techniques to larger models and data-sets as well as prototyping algorithms for neuromorphic hardware~\citep{Davies2018,Furber2014,Merolla2014}, new tools are required which can efficiently simulate SNNs on existing hardware. 
The development of efficient SNN simulators has been a key area of computational neuroscience research for several decades~\citep{carnevale2006neuron, Gewaltig2007, Golosio2021, Akar2019,Yavuz2016} but, these simulators are not well-suited to the types of model and the workflows required for spike-based machine learning research.
As such, many ML researchers have chosen to build libraries~\citep{norse2021, SpikingJelly, eshraghian2021training,Hazan2018} on top of more familiar tools such as PyTorch.
However, while libraries like PyTorch are highly-optimised for rate-based models, they does not take advantage of the spatio-temporal sparsity of SNNs which have the potential to enable massive computational savings over rate-based networks~\citep{Yin2021}.

While our GeNN simulator~\citep{Yavuz2016,Knight2018,Knight2021} was originally developed for Computational Neuroscience research, its longstanding focus on flexibility and its targeting of GPU accelerators has made it easily adaptable to the needs of spike-based ML.
Specifically, we have added support for parallel batch simulation of models which allows multiple copies of the model to be run simultaneously to maximise GPU occupancy.
We have also added support for user-defined ``custom update'' operations which can be used to implement a wide range of functionality including gradient-based optimizers, efficient matrix transpose operations and the reduction of variables across batches.
In this paper we demonstrate how these new extensions can be used to efficiently implement and train SNN classifiers using eProp~\citep{Bellec2020} on the Spiking Heidelberg Digits~\citep{Cramer2020} and the Spiking Sequential MNIST~\citep{Plank2021} datasets.

\section{Results}
We trained LSNNs of various sizes with feedforward and recurrent connectivity on the Spiking Heidelberg Digits~(SHD)~\citep{Cramer2020} and spiking sequential MNIST~\citep{Plank2021} datasets using eProp with the default parameters~\citep{Bellec2020}.
We found no considerable differences in the performance of eProp models with \num{256} neurons on the SHD dataset compared to using BPTT~\citep{Zenke2021a}  (figure~\ref{fig:shd_performance}). 
However, the reduced memory requirement of eProp allows training larger models, and we were able to discover that performance significantly improves for \num{512} neurons. 
While being able to train networks with high classification accuracy is important, training also needs to be fast.
Figure~\ref{fig:training_time} shows how the training time for recurrent LSNNs using eProp with GeNN compares against training recurrent LIF networks using BPTT with PyTorch code from \citet{Zenke2021a}.
For short input sequences, training with GeNN is slower but, the runtime of GeNN simulations increases less with sequence length and, because BPTT requires the state of the model to be recorded every time step, PyTorch cannot train models larger than \num{256} neurons on \num{1370} timestep input sequences with our chosen batch size of \num{512} due to memory constraints.
Figure~\ref{fig:lstm_vs_genn} compares the inference time and energy delay products~(EDPs) of LSNNs simulated with GeNN against LSTM models running on the same hardware~\citep{Plank2021} as well as LSNNs running on the Loihi neuromorphic chip~\citep{Davies2018}.
On the same Titan V GPU, LSNNs are faster than LSTMs and have a lower EDP across all batch sizes.
Compared to using LSTMs, LSNN inference has a much lower arithmetic intensity meaning that, at batch size 1, not only is the CPU code generated by GeNN faster than TensorFlow running on CPU but it is also faster than GeNN running on GPU.
Finally, although LSNN inference on Loihi has a much lower Energy-Delay Product, inference on both GPU and CPU using GeNN has lower latency.

\section{Conclusions}
While the results we have presented in this paper demonstrate that the approximations behind the eProp learning rule do not necessarily prevent it enablig competitive performane in relatively complex datasets, eProp does have some significant issues.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Eligibility traces are unique to each pair of connected pre and postsynaptic neurons so cannot be efficiently added to convolutional models
\end{itemize}
However, the eProp learning rule requires time-driven updates which dominate the time taken to \emph{train} these models.
Therefore, we are working to implement the fully event-driven EventProp~\citep{Wunderlich2021} learning rule in GeNN which will allow training times to also benefit from temporal sparsity.
Finally, the models presented in this paper are all densely connected so are not taking advantage of connection sparsity.
We are working in parallel to address this by combining these learning rules with the Deep-R~\citep{Bellec2018a} rewiring rule, enabling SNN classifiers to take advantage of GeNN's support for efficient sparse connectivity~\citep{Knight2018}.
