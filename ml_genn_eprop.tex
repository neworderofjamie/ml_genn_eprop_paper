\section{Introduction}
The development of efficient spiking neural network (SNN) simulators has been a key area of computational neuroscience research for several decades~\citep{carnevale2006neuron, Gewaltig2007, Golosio2021, Akar2019,Yavuz2016}.
However, the prevalent SNN simulators are not well-suited to the types of models and the workflows required for spike-based machine learning (ML).
Consequently, many ML researchers have chosen to build libraries~\citep{norse2021, SpikingJelly,eshraghian2021training,Hazan2018,zhao_neko_2021} on top of frameworks such as PyTorch~\citep{paszke2019pytorch} and TensorFlow~\citep{TensorFlow} which allow defining SNNs in an environment that is familiar to ML researchers.
In these libraries, the activity of a population of neurons is typically represented as a vector of activations and, for an SNN, this vector is populated with ones for neurons that are spiking and zeros for quiescent neurons. 
This representation allows using the existing infrastructure of the underlying ML library for SNNs but, as real neurons often spike at comparatively low rates, propagating the activity of inactive neurons through the network leads to many unnecessary computations.
Additionally, the connections between populations of neurons can be sparse, in particular in biologically inspired SNNs. In standard ML libraries, sparse connections are typically implemented as a weight matrix containing many zeros.

To avoid these inefficiencies we have developed mlGeNN -- a new library for spike-based ML built on the GPU-optimised sparse data structures and algorithms provided by our GeNN simulator~\citep{Yavuz2016,Knight2018,Knight2021}.
We previously presented an initial version of mlGeNN~\citep{Turner2022} which provided workflows for converting ANNs trained using TensorFlow~\citep{TensorFlow} into SNNs that could be simulated using GeNN.
However, while we found that performing inference using our converted SNNs was faster than with competing libraries, SNNs are inherently at a disadvantage for static image classification as by their nature they turn a single inference step in an ANN library into SNN dynamics across several, often numerous, timesteps.
In this paper we introduce a second module of mlGeNN focused on training SNNs from scratch. This allows tackling ML problems that are inherently more suitable for SNNs because they contain a temporal dimension, for instance.

\section{mlGeNN}
While fully describing the functionality of mlGeNN is beyond the scope of this paper, in the following sections we present an overview of some of our design descisions and the current feature set of mlGeNN.
For more information about mlGeNN, we invite readers to visit github and explore our online documention~\todo{cite}.

\subsection{Describing models}
Machine learning frameworks such as PyTorch~\citep{paszke2019pytorch} and TensorFlow~\citep{TensorFlow} are designed to efficiently process directed and acyclical computational graphs.
In order to express recurrent connectivity within an otherwise directed acylical graph, special recurrent layers are required to `hide' the cyclical nature of the recurrent connectivity.
However, when beginning to consider more brain-like models with highly recurrent connectivity, the whole model is likely to become one big recurrent layer which is not likely to be an efficient representation.

By contrast, mlGeNN allows Spiking Neural Networks~(SNNs) with arbitrary topologys to be defined in terms of homogenous groups of neurons described by \lstinline{Population} objects connected together with \lstinline{Connection} objects.
While this type of model description is common amongst SNN simulators used for computational neuroscience, the key difference in mlGeNN is that -- like in ML frameworks -- the model description isPoissonInput totally agnostic to how it is going to be trained.
\lstinline{Connection} objects don't need to provide a model of how it's weights will be trained and additional learning-rule specific structure such as feedback connections do not need to be added by hand.

All populations and connections are owned by a \lstinline{Network} object which acts as a context manager.
A network with two populations of neurons could be simply created like:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
network = Network()
with network:
    a = Population("poisson_input", 100)
    b = Population("integrate_fire", 100,
                   readout="spike_count")

    Connection(a, b, Dense(1.0))
\end{lstlisting}

For simplicity, in this example, built in neuron models with default parameters are specified using strings.
However, if you wish to override some of the default model parameters, use a model that does not have default parameters or use a model not built into mlGeNN, you can also specify a neuron model using a \lstinline{Neuron} class instance.
For example, if we wished for the poisson population to emit positive and negative spikes for positive and negative input values and for the integrate-and-fire 
neuron to have a higher firing threshold we could instantiate \lstinline{PoissonInput} and \lstinline{IntegrateFire} objects ourselves like:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
network = Network()
with network:
    a = Population(
        PoissonInput(signed_spikes=True), 100)
    b = Population(
        IntegrateFire(v_thresh=2.0), 100,
        readout="spike_count")

    Connection(a, b, Dense(1.0))
\end{lstlisting}

By default, \lstinline{Connection} objects use a `delta' synapse model where the accumulated weight of incoming spikes is directly injected into neurons. 
However, if you wish to use a somewhat more realistic model where inputs are \emph{shaped} to mimic the dynamics of real ion channels, this can be swapped

While the flexibility to create networks with any topology is very useful, mlGeNN also provides a \lstinline{SequentialNetwork} wrapper class -- inspired by \lstinline{Sequential} models in Keras -- for specifying common feedforward model more tersely:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
network = SequentialNetwork()
with network:
    a = InputLayer("poisson_input", 100)
    b = Layer(Dense(1.0), "integrate_fire", 100,
              readout="spike_count")
\end{lstlisting}

Finally, in the same way that Keras can easily be extended by subclassing built in classes and implementing new functionality using TensorFlow constructs, mlGeNN can be extended by subclassing  built in classes and providing PyGeNN model descriptions. 
A full description of the model description syntax is beyond the scope of this work but, is described in more detail in our documentation~\todo{cite} and previous work~\citep{Knight2021}.
Nonetheless, the following example illustrates how a minimal Integrate-and-Fire neuron model could be defined for use in mlGeNN:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
genn_model = {
    "var_name_types": [("V", "scalar")],
    "sim_code": "$(V) += $(Isyn);",
    "threshold_condition_code": "$(V) >= 1.0",
    "reset_code": "$(V) = 0.0;",
    "is_auto_refractory_required": False}

class IntegrateFire(Neuron):
    v = ValueDescriptor("V")

    def __init__(self, v = 0.0, softmax = False, 
                 readout=None):
        super(IntegrateFire, self).__init__(
            softmax, readout)
        self.v = v

    def get_model(self, population, dt):
        return NeuronModel.from_val_descriptors(
            genn_model, "V", self, dt)
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{Using models for training and inference}
Once a network structure has been defined, mlGeNN provides a range of \emph{compilers} to produce GeNN models which can then be used for training or inference.
The simplest compiler is the \lstinline{InferenceCompiler} which builds a GeNN model with static weights and parallel batching support for efficiently performing inference on an SNN model:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
compiler = InferenceCompiler(
    evaluate_timesteps=1500, batch_size=512)

compiled_net = compiler.compile(network)
\end{lstlisting}

The resulting \lstinline{compiled_net} object can then be used to evaluate the network on a dataset:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
metrics, _  = compiled_net.evaluate(
    {input: inputs}, {output: labels})
\end{lstlisting}

By default, the evaluation method calculates sparse categorical accuracy against the provided labels but mlGeNN also provides alternative metrics for regression tasks and custom metrics can be easily implemented.
As well as supporting the conversion of trained ANN models to SNNs as described in our previous work~\citep{Turner2022}, mlGeNN now provides an e-prop compiler which enables models to be trained using the e-prop learning rule~\citep{Bellec2020}.
This compiler checks the validity of the model and automatically adds the appropriate learning rules to its connections as well as feedback connections and error signal calculation logic:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
compiler = EPropCompiler(
    example_timesteps=1500,
    losses="sparse_categorical_crossentropy",
    optimiser="adam", batch_size=512)

compiled_net = compiler.compile(network)
\end{lstlisting}
Note that here again, loss functions and optimisers with default parameters are specified using strings but these are also fully customisable.
After compiling with the \lstinline{EPropCompiler}, the \lstinline{compiled_net} object can then be used to train the network on a dataset:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
metrics, _  = compiled_net.train(
    {input: inputs}, {output: labels},
    num_epochs=args.num_epochs, shuffle=True)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Recording and debugging}
One of the challenges of working with SNNs, compared to standard ANNs, is that neurons are stateful so the ability to efficiently record and visualise model state is vital for an efficient workflow.
Inspired by Keras, mlGeNN has a callback system which -- as well as being used internally to implement progress bars, trigger processes such as weight updates during model training etc -- can be used by the user to configure the recording of state variables and spikes.

\lstinline{VarRecorder} can be used to record a population state variable over time and \lstinline{SpikeRecorder} can be used to efficiently record spikes (using the efficient system described in \citet{Knight2021}).
For example here, we record the spikes emitted by the first \lstinline{a} layer and the membrane voltages of the second \lstinline{b} layer of the previous example:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
callbacks = [SpikeRecorder(a, key="a_spikes"),
             VarRecorder(b, "V", key="b_v")]
metrics, cb_data = compiled_net.evaluate(
    {input: inputs}, {output: labels},
    callbacks=callbacks)
\end{lstlisting}

The \lstinline{key} strings are used to uniquely identify recorded data produced by callbacks and, after the simulation has completed, allow the recorded variables to be retrieved from the \lstinline{cb_data} dictionary returned when evaluating (or training) the model.
For example the membrane voltages emitted by all neurons during the first example could be accessed using \lstinline{cb_data["b_v"][0]}.

In machine learning workflows where models may be trained for millions of timesteps, it is also important to be able to \emph{filter} what data is recorded to particular areas/stages of training to save memory and reduce overheads.
Both \lstinline{SpikeRecorder} and \lstinline{VarRecorder} support filtering by neuron or example e.g. \\ \lstinline{SpikeRecorder(a, neuron=np.s_[0::2])} could be used to record spikes from every other neuron and \lstinline{SpikeRecorder(a, example_filter=1000)} could be used to only record during the 1000th example.


\section{Results}
In order to demonstrate the value of mlGeNN for spike-based ML research, here we present the results of a small exploration of SNN architectures, trained using e-prop~\citep{Bellec2020} on the DVS gesture dataset~\citep{amir_low_2017} which has been recently used to evaluate the EGRU~\citep{subramoney2022egru} and FPTT~\citep{yin2021accurate} learning rules.
This dataset consists of \num{1342} recordings of \num{11} different hand and arm gestures, collected from \num{29} subjects under three different lighting condition using a DVS 128 event-based camera~\citep{lichtsteiner_128times128_2008}.
Here we used the Tonic library~\citep{lenz_gregor_2021_5079802} to access the dataset and spatially downsample the events to $32\times32$.
While mlGeNN does not depend on Tonic, it includes a \lstinline{preprocess_tonic_spikes} helper function which converts spike trains from Tonic datasets into mlGeNN's internal format.

  Bars signify the mean and error bars the standard deviation of 5 models trained with different seeds.}
  \label{fig:dense_accuracy}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Accuracy}
Figure~\ref{fig:dense_accuracy} shows the accuracy of a wide selection of one and two layer classifier models trained with e-prop.
These include configurations with and without recurrent connections and using both Adaptive and standard Leaky Integrate-and-Fire~(LIF and ALIF) neuron models.
Of the single layer classifiers, the variant with a single layer of 512 recurrently connected ALIF neurons performs the best, achieving an accuracy of \SI{89.55 \pm 1.22}{\percent} on the test set.
Although this model only has a single hidden layer and around \num{1.3E6} parameters, it out-performs a two layer EGRU model~\citep{subramoney2022egru} with over $4\times$ as many parameters which achieved \SI{88.02}{\percent} accuracy.

Models using ALIF neurons also perform better than those using simpler LIF neurons in all of the two layer configurations.
Interesting, similar to the architecture employed by \citet{yin2021accurate}, the best performing model -- with an accuracy of \SI{91.00 \pm 1}{\percent} on test set -- has a feedforward first layer followed by a recurrent second layer rather than two recurrently connected layers.
While this performance is slightly lower than the \SI{91.89 \pm 0.16}{\percent} reported by \citet{yin2021accurate}, our model has approximately a third the number of parameters (\num{0.66e6} vs \num{1.8e6})

One of the significant advantages of mlGeNN is that it can exploit sparse connectivity to reduce training and inference time so, in the final part of our architectural exploration, we explore the effect of sparsity on the performance of our two best performing models (ALIF512R and ALIF256F-ALIF256R).

\subsection{Performance}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Training time - compare to FPTT \SI{400}{\milli\second} per frame with batch size 64 on some sort of \SI{24}{\giga\byte} GPU
    \item Inference time CPU and GPU - compare to real-time
    \item Show effect of sparsity on performance
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusions}
We hope that the mlGeNN library we describe in this paper will be as valuable to the community as it was in generating the results presented in this paper.
While it is by no means a precise measure, the simplicity and ease of using mlGeNN is illustrated by the fact that the code used for all simulations was less than \num{300} lines whereas, when we used PyGeNN directly in our previous work~\citep{Knight2022} one \num{900} line model was required for training and a seperate \num{500} line model for inference.

The results we have presented in this paper demonstrate that the approximation nature of the e-prop learning rule does not necessarily prevent it offering competitive performance on relatively complex datasets.
However, e-prop does have some significant issues.
Firstly, e-prop requires time-driven updates which dominates the time taken to train models.
We demonstrate that by using sparse connectivity, this can be reduced and, in initial unpublished experiments, we have found that by combining sparse connectivity with the Deep-R~\citep{Bellec2018a} rewiring rule, much of the performance lost due to the sparser connectivity can be recovered.
Secondly and unsuprisingly for a visual task, both the original experiments on the DVS gesture dataset~\citep{amir_low_2017} and more recent work using the Decolle and FPTT learning rules~\citep{Kaiser2020,yin2021accurate}, showed that a convolutional SNN can achieve significantly higher performance than shallow recurrent networks.
However, because the eligibility traces which drive e-prop weight updates are calculated from the product of pre and postsynaptic activity, they cannot be shared across all the synapses in each connection.
Neither the FPPT~\citep{yin2021accurate} learning rule -- where the additional $\bar{\Phi}_t$ state variable only depends on past weights so can be shared -- and EventProp~\citep{Wunderlich2021} -- which does not require any additional synaptic state -- have these issues so are much more suitable for training convolutional architectures.

Therefore, based on the promising initial results presented by \citet{NowotnyLoss2022}, we are working to develop an mlGeNN compiler for the EventProp~\citep{Wunderlich2021} learning rule which will allow convolutional models to be trained and to reduce training times by taking advantage of temporal sparsity through purely event-driven training.
